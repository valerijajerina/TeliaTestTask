Author: Valerina Jerina

This gitHub directory is a submission of Telia internship test task. 

For sample task I've taken the only active NLP task: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/code

All solutions are located in the `test_solution_kaggle.ipynb`. The process of solution is explained in details. 

`kaggle` folder contains datasets, originally it also contained embedding file, however it is to heavy to commit into Git. Here is the link for the file:  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/authman/pickled-glove840b300d-for-10sec-loading

Kaggle final score: 0.57431
